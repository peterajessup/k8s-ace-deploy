# k8s-ace-deploy

This repository is to be used for creating an ACE Integration Server on IKS kubernetes.

The artifacts include an Integration Server Custom resource definition and configuration object.

The repo relies on a barfile previously uploaded to an instance of the ACE Dashboard running in the ace namespace.
This bar URL is referenced in the yaml describing the integration server - change for your own instance.
